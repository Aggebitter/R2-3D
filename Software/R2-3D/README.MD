## R2-3D


This is the very much under developmnet of my supporting co processor for the R2-3D printer.

The concept is to not fidle around in the main printer firmware just sniff the trafic on the serial interface and do some 
other nice taskt like controling RGB leds and making sounds (Well, R2-D2 feels like a good feedback voice for R2-3D9) 
Depending on the final R2-3D it might do the heat chamber controll. 

### main features that are under development is as follows:

Display printer head's and printer bed temperatures (It does sniff att 250000 Kbit and display it on my 7-segment)

RGB leds (noting done yet, just got the hardware)

Sound (noting done yet, just got the hardware, but found some nice files, aka ringtones in MP3 format)
Please Lukas art, Don't kill me for telling ;-)
